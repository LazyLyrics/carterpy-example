# carter-py example

## Usage

- Clone the repo
- [Optional] Create a virtual environment
- [Optional] Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
  - `CARTERPY_API_KEY` - Your API key
  - `PLAYER_ID` - Your player ID
  - `PLAYER_NAME` - Your player name
- Install the requirements
- Run `main.py`

The script will run and ask you for any necessary variables not specified in the `.env` file. If a player ID is not specified, `carterpy` will use a random one, so be sure to provide one if you want your character to recognise you.

## example .env file

```env
CARTERPY_API_KEY=your-api-key
PLAYER_ID=your-player-id
PLAYER_NAME=your-player-name
OPENER=True
```
